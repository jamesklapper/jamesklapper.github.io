                  <p>
                    The Audiological evaluation is performed to assess the severity, configuration, and nature of the hearing loss, and whether the hearing loss is medically treatable/ or permanent. It consists of hearing threshold
                    for pure tone sounds and speech testing and is performed in a sound-proof room. An audiological evaluation process is usually completed within 30 minutes, and the evaluation results with the management can be
                    discussed following completion of the evaluation.
